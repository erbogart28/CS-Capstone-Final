* Please read ALL issues and commit messages!!!

* Push code out here you are working on even if you are not done! This will help us track progress better.

* (This goes without saying, but I'll reitterate) <b>DO NOT MERGE BRANCHES UNTIL APROVED BY ANOTHER GROUP MEMBER. </b>

* If your code is not a drastic change, and you are CERTAIN it will interact well with master branch, then you can merge at your own risk.
